I'm a 5th year student [@FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en) and I'm currently
based in Zagreb, Croatia. I am a junior software engineer with a focus on web development. I prefer working with frontend technologies such as React & Vue.js. Here you can find some general information about me, such as my preferred stack & projects. Oh and I'll share my thoughts on various things here. Opinions are my own.
